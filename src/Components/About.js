        As a web developer and graduate of Queen's University with a Bachelor of
        Computing, I look for opportunities to compliment my passion for
        innovation and technology. I have experience working on various stages
        of the software development lifecycle as a quality assurance engineer
        and in product support and am looking to gain more experience developing
        as a full stack developer. My interests range from software
        applications, social media, fashion, design, music, and sports.{" "}
